      I'm Bilcrist Abraham, a passionate individual with a strong interest in interactive media design. Currently enrolled in the Interactive Media Design program at Algonquin College, Ottawa Campus, I am eager to explore the exciting world of design and technology. Through my coursework, I am acquiring skills in graphic design, user experience (UX), and web development. I believe in the power of creativity and innovation to shape engaging and impactful digital experiences. Outside of my studies, I enjoy immersing myself in various artistic pursuits, including illustration and photography. I am driven by a desire to blend aesthetics and functionality to create visually stunning and user-friendly designs.
